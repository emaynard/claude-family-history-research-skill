# Research Log Guidance & Best Practices

This document provides comprehensive guidance for creating detailed research logs following professional genealogical standards. Use this alongside the simplified `research-log-template.md` for your daily research work.

## Overview

A research log is a systematic record of your research activities, sources searched, findings discovered, and evidence analyzed. It serves multiple purposes:
- **Documentation**: Proves your research was reasonably exhaustive
- **Accountability**: Supports your conclusions with cited evidence
- **Continuity**: Allows you to pick up where you left off
- **Quality Control**: Helps identify gaps and conflicts
- **Professional Standard**: Meets Genealogical Proof Standard (GPS) requirements

## Session Metadata

### Essential Information

**Date, Researcher, Session Number:**
- Record the date you conducted research
- Include your name (useful if shared with collaborators)
- Number sessions sequentially for this research project
- Include time spent for tracking research effort

**Research Context:**
- Clearly state your research goal (one session, one goal)
- Identify the specific ancestor or project
- List the research questions you're trying to answer
- Reference your overall research plan if you have one

## Sources Searched - Comprehensive Documentation

### Complete Source Table

Track ALL sources searched, including those with negative results:

| Source | Location/Access | Date Range Searched | Search Strategy | Results |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------|
| [Database name] | [Online/Physical] | [Years] | [Exact names, variations, filters] | [Found/Not Found/Partial] |

### Search Strategies - Document Your Method

For each major source searched, document:

**Search Approach:**
- Did you search the exact name?
- What name variations did you try? (maiden names, alternate spellings, nicknames)
- What date ranges did you search? (broader than expected? narrower?)
- What geographic filters/limits did you use?
- Did you browse manually or use keyword search?
- What specific fields did you search?

**Challenges Encountered:**
- Database interface difficulties
- Name variations creating confusion
- Records not indexed as expected
- Access limitations
- Time constraints

**Time Investment:**
- How long did this source take?
- Was the time spent proportional to the importance of the source?

### Negative Results Are Evidence

**Sources Expected to Contain Information But Didn't:**
1. [Source name]
   - **Expected:** What information you thought would be there
   - **Search Strategy:** How thoroughly you searched (all variations? full date range?)
   - **Possible Reasons:** Why information might be absent (destroyed? indexed differently? person not in database?)
   - **Implications:** What this tells you (moved away? changed name? didn't exist?)

Negative results are just as important as positive ones. They prove your research was reasonably exhaustive.

## Findings & Discoveries - Systematic Documentation

### Organize by Source

For each finding, document the complete context:

**Finding: [Description]**
- **Source:** [Full Evidence Explained citation]
- **Key Information:**
  - Names (exactly as written in document)
  - Dates (birth, marriage, death, or event dates)
  - Locations (jurisdictions, specific places)
  - Relationships (parent-child, spouse, sibling)
  - Other details (occupation, residency, status)
- **Exact Wording:** "[Quote from document if relevant]"
- **Significance:** How this answers your research questions
- **New Questions Raised:** What does this make you wonder about?
- **Source Quality:** Is this original or derivative? How reliable?

### Unexpected Discoveries

Document anything surprising or unanticipated:
- Side-line discoveries about other ancestors
- Information contradicting previous assumptions
- Clues suggesting different research directions
- Contextual information that changes interpretation

---

## Source Citations - Complete Documentation

### Evidence Explained Format

Provide complete, formal citations for all sources (positive and negative results):

1. **Fully cited as per Evidence Explained methodology**
2. **Include retrieval information** (database, search terms, date accessed for online sources)
3. **Cite even negative results** (source you searched thoroughly but found no information)
4. **Complete citations prove your research** and allow others to verify

### Citation Elements

Your citations should include:
- **Author/Creator** (if applicable)
- **Title** (of record, database, book, etc.)
- **Publication/Access Information**
- **Specific page/entry/image reference**
- **Date accessed** (for online sources)
- **Search terms used** (if searching database)

---

## Evidence Analysis - Critical Evaluation

### Distinguish Facts from Interpretation

**Facts Learned:**
- Information directly stated in documents
- Include source for each fact
- Record exactly as stated (even if you think it's wrong)

**Interpretation:**
- Your analysis of what the facts mean
- Connections you've made
- Conclusions you're drawing
- Keep separate from factual information

### Evidence Type Classification

**Direct Evidence:**
- Explicitly states the fact being proven
- Example: "John Smith, born 15 May 1845, son of Robert and Mary Smith"

**Indirect Evidence:**
- Suggests a relationship but doesn't state it explicitly
- Example: John listed as head of household in 1870 census with children born 1850-1865
- Requires analysis to interpret

**Negative Evidence:**
- Expected records not found
- Proves exhaustive search but something is missing
- Requires interpretation (moved away? not recorded? false assumption?)

### Reliability Assessment

**Evaluate each source for reliability:**

**High Reliability:**
- Original records (not copies)
- Made close to the event
- By someone with knowledge of the facts
- No obvious bias or errors

**Moderate Reliability:**
- Derivative records or secondary sources
- Made some time after the event
- Based on available information but not original

**Low Reliability:**
- Family folklore or oral tradition
- Secondary sources far removed from events
- Known errors or inconsistencies
- Written long after the event

### Identify Conflicts & Discrepancies

**Conflicting Information:**

1. [Description of conflict]
   - Source A says: [Statement and citation]
   - Source B says: [Statement and citation]
   - Nature of conflict: [Date discrepancy? Location? Name? Relationship?]
   - Preliminary assessment: [Which seems more reliable and why?]
   - Further research needed: [What would help resolve this?]

Document conflicts honestly. They don't weaken your researchâ€”resolving them strengthens it.

## Document & Image Management

### File Organization

**If obtaining documents or images:**

| Filename | Content Description | Source | Quality | Date Obtained |
|----------|-------------------|--------|---------|---------------|
| [filename.jpg] | [1870 census, John Smith household] | [FamilySearch] | [Good/Fair/Poor] | [DATE] |

**File Naming Convention:**
- Use consistent, descriptive names
- Include ancestor name, date, source, type
- Example: `Smith_John_1870Census_Coshocton_OH.jpg`

**Storage Location:**
- Primary storage location (hard drive, cloud)
- Backup location
- Organization method (by ancestor? by source type? by date?)
- Naming conventions used

### Document Transcription

If you transcribe records:

**Source:** [Full citation]

**Transcription:**
[Exact text of document, preserving original spelling, capitalization, punctuation]

[unclear] = unclear text
[damaged] = damaged/illegible portion
[sic] = note obvious errors

## Getting Started

1. **Use the practical template** (`research-log-template.md`) for daily research
2. **Refer to this guidance** when you need detailed explanations
3. **Adapt to your needs** - not every section applies to every session
4. **Be consistent** - develop a personal system and stick with it
5. **Be thorough** - good documentation takes time but pays off

Remember: Your research log is proof of your work. Make it detailed enough that someone else (or you, six months later) could understand exactly what you did and why.
