## Project Objective

### How to Write Effective Research Questions

A good research question is:
- **Specific:** Focuses on one person or family relationship
- **Answerable:** Based on records that likely exist
- **Clear:** States exactly what you want to discover

### Examples

**Good Research Questions:**
- "Determine the birth location and parents of John Smith (b. circa 1820, d. 1895 in Ohio)"
- "Identify the maiden name and parents of Mary Johnson (b. 1845, married 1865)"
- "Establish when and where the Thompson family migrated from Virginia to Kentucky"

**Too Broad:**
- "Learn about the Smith family"
- "Find ancestors in Europe"

**Too Vague:**
- "Find information about John"
- "Research family history"

## Research Questions

### Creating Prioritized Questions

Research questions should be ranked by:
1. **Primary:** The main question that needs answering
2. **Supporting:** Questions that help answer the primary question
3. **Contextual:** Background information that aids research

### Example Question List

1. Where was John Smith born and when? (PRIMARY)
2. Who were John Smith's parents? (PRIMARY)
3. Where did John Smith reside between 1835-1845? (SUPPORTING)
4. When did John Smith migrate to Ohio? (SUPPORTING)
5. Are there siblings who can provide clues to origins? (CONTEXTUAL)
6. What church did the family attend? (CONTEXTUAL)
7. Who were John Smith's neighbors in 1850? (CONTEXTUAL - FAN principle)

## Research Strategy

### Four-Phase Approach

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Focus:** Establish basic timeline and collect easily accessible records

**Activities:**
- Search online census records for all available years
- Locate death certificate for end-of-life information
- Search online vital records indexes
- Review FamilySearch and Ancestry trees (with caution)
- Search FindAGrave for burial information

**Goal:** Create solid foundation of dates, locations, and family composition

#### Phase 2: Core Research (Weeks 3-6)
**Focus:** Obtain primary sources and expand timeline

**Activities:**
- Request vital records from county/state agencies
- Search land and property records
- Research probate and estate files
- Examine church records
- Review military pension files if applicable

**Goal:** Fill gaps in knowledge and collect original documents

#### Phase 3: Expansion (Weeks 7-10)
**Focus:** Collateral research and supporting evidence

**Activities:**
- Research siblings and associates (FAN principle)
- Review published county histories
- Search newspapers for obituaries and notices
- Investigate church membership records
- Explore social organizations and memberships

**Goal:** Build comprehensive picture through indirect evidence

#### Phase 4: Analysis and Documentation (Weeks 11-12)
**Focus:** Evaluate evidence and document conclusions

**Activities:**
- Analyze and correlate all evidence
- Resolve conflicting information
- Build proof argument
- Write research report
- Create evidence analysis

**Goal:** Meet Genealogical Proof Standard and document findings

### Strategic Approaches

#### FAN Principle
**Family, Associates, and Neighbors**

Research extends beyond the primary subject to include:
- **Family:** Parents, siblings, children, cousins, in-laws
- **Associates:** Business partners, witnesses on documents, godparents
- **Neighbors:** Those living nearby in census, deed witnesses, church members

**Why It Works:** When direct evidence is missing, studying the network often reveals clues through indirect references.

#### Cluster Research
Identify surname clusters or communities to study together:
- Families who migrated together
- Same-surname families in one area
- Religious or ethnic communities

#### Geographic Strategy
Follow migration patterns:
- Work backward from last known location
- Study common migration routes
- Research origin areas based on naming patterns
- Consider chain migration (following family/friends)

#### Chronological Approach
- **Forward:** Start from earliest known ancestor, move forward
- **Backward:** Start from known person, work back in time (usually more effective)
- **Targeted:** Focus on specific time period where answers likely exist

## Genealogical Proof Standard (GPS)

The Genealogical Proof Standard requires five elements for any genealogical conclusion:

### 1. Reasonably Exhaustive Research

**What It Means:** Search thoroughly in sources likely to contain relevant information.

**In Your Plan:**
- List all applicable record types for time period and location
- Search both direct sources (vital records) and indirect (FAN research)
- Document negative results (sources that didn't have information)
- Consider both online and offline repositories

**Example:** For a birth location question, search:
- Birth records (if available for time period)
- Census records showing birthplace
- Death certificate with birthplace
- Marriage record with age/birthplace
- Obituary mentioning birth
- Bible records
- Church baptism

### 2. Complete and Accurate Source Citations

**What It Means:** Cite all sources completely so others can find them.

**In Your Plan:**
- Use Evidence Explained citation format
- Record enough detail to relocate source
- Note repository, collection, volume/page, digital location
- Maintain citation library or database

**Example Citation:**
"Ohio, Coshocton County, Probate Court, Estate Files, 1850-1900, John Smith estate file (1895); Coshocton County Courthouse, Coshocton."

### 3. Analysis and Correlation

**What It Means:** Evaluate each source's information quality and reliability, then compare information from multiple sources.

**In Your Plan:**
- Classify sources (original vs. derivative, primary vs. secondary)
- Assess information reliability
- Create comparison matrices for key facts
- Note patterns and consistencies

**Example:**
| Source | Birth Year | Birth Location | Information Type | Reliability |
|--------|-----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| 1850 Census | circa 1820 | Ohio | Secondary | Medium |
| Death Cert | 1822 | Virginia | Primary | High |
| Tombstone | 1820 | Not listed | Secondary | Low |

### 4. Resolution of Conflicting Evidence

**What It Means:** Identify contradictions and explain which evidence is most reliable.

**In Your Plan:**
- List all conflicts found
- Assess reliability of each conflicting source
- Apply preponderance of evidence principle
- Document reasoning for choosing one source over another

**Example:**
"Birth year conflict: Census says 1820, death certificate says 1822. Death certificate is preferred because: (1) it's primary information from someone who knew the birth year, (2) it's original information recorded at time of death, (3) census ages are often approximations."

### 5. Soundly Reasoned Conclusion

**What It Means:** Build a logical argument from evidence to conclusion.

**In Your Plan:**
- State conclusion clearly
- Demonstrate logical progression from evidence to conclusion
- Assign appropriate proof level (Proven, Probable, Possible, Disproven, Undetermined)
- Address alternative hypotheses

**Example:**
"Conclusion: John Smith was probably born in 1822 in Virginia based on: (1) death certificate primary information, (2) pattern of Virginia births for siblings, (3) migration timing consistent with Virginia origin, (4) naming patterns suggest Virginia family connections. Proof level: Probable (not proven due to lack of birth record)."

## Revision and Updates

### When to Update Research Plan

Update your plan when:
- New information changes research direction
- Research questions answered (mark complete, add new ones)
- Discovery of new relevant record sources
- Timeline adjustments needed
- Strategy proves ineffective and needs revision

### Documenting Changes

Use the Revision History section to track:
- Date of update
- What changed and why
- New directions or strategies
- Completed phases or questions

**Example:**
```
- **2024-01-15** - Research plan created
- **2024-02-01** - Updated strategy after finding John Smith in 1850 census
  in Pennsylvania, not Ohio as expected; added Pennsylvania repositories
- **2024-02-20** - Question 1 answered (birth location: PA); added new
  question about parents' origins
- **2024-03-10** - Completed Phase 1 and 2; moving to collateral research
```
