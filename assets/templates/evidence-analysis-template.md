- [ ] Limitations acknowledged
- [ ] Appropriate proof level

---

## Conclusion and Proof Argument

### Conclusion Statement

[Answer the research question directly and specifically]

**Example:** "John Smith was born in Ohio, circa 1820, most likely between 1818-1822. Birth location in Ohio is probable; specific county undetermined."

---

### Proof Level

- [ ] **Proven** - Beyond reasonable doubt, no credible conflicts
- [ ] **Probable** - Preponderance of evidence supports, minor conflicts resolved
- [ ] **Possible** - Some evidence supports, significant gaps remain
- [ ] **Unproven** - Insufficient evidence
- [ ] **Disproven** - Evidence contradicts hypothesis

---

### Proof Argument

[Write coherent narrative argument explaining reasoning]

**Structure:**
1. State conclusion
2. Present strongest evidence
3. Explain source evaluation
4. Address conflicts and resolution
5. Apply evidence weight / demonstrate preponderance
6. Acknowledge limitations
7. Justify proof level

**Example:**
The preponderance of evidence supports John Smith's birth in Ohio around 1820. Three independent federal census enumerations (1850, 1860, 1870) consistently report his birthplace as Ohio, with ages progressing logically... [Continue with full proof argument as shown in examples]
