4. Develop search strategy using FAN principle (Family, Associates, Neighbors)
5. Create timeline with milestones
6. Establish success criteria and proof requirements

**Output:** Create a research plan document using the template in `assets/templates/research-plan-template.md`

### 2. Citation Creation

Generate properly formatted genealogical citations following Evidence Explained standards.

**Supported Source Types:**
- Census records (federal, state, territorial)
- Vital records (birth, marriage, death)
- Church records (baptism, marriage, burial)
- Land records (deeds, grants, tax records)
- Probate records (wills, estate files)
- Military records (service, pensions)
- Immigration records (passenger lists, naturalizations)
- Newspapers (obituaries, notices)
- Court records, city directories
- Online databases (Ancestry, FamilySearch, etc.)
- Published books and manuscripts

**Citation Process:**
1. Identify source type and access method
2. Gather core information (who, what, when, where)
3. Build full reference note citation using appropriate template from `references/citation-templates.md`
4. Create short form for subsequent references
5. Generate source list entry for bibliography
6. Assess source quality (original vs. derivative, primary vs. secondary)

**Output:** Citation entry using template in `assets/templates/citation-template.md`

### 3. Evidence Analysis and Conflict Resolution

Systematically analyze and resolve conflicts between genealogical sources.

**Analysis Framework:**

**Step 1: Inventory Sources**
- List all sources providing information about the fact
- Categorize by evidence type (direct/indirect/negative)

**Step 2: Evaluate Each Source**
- Source classification (original/derivative/authored)
- Information type (primary/secondary/undetermined)
- Informant analysis (who, relationship, knowledge level)
- Reliability factors (timing, bias, consistency)

**Step 3: Compare and Identify Conflicts**
- Create evidence comparison matrix
- Document specific discrepancies
- Assess significance of conflicts

**Step 4: Assess Reliability**
- Rank sources from most to least reliable
- Weight sources by quality, not quantity
- Consider corroboration patterns

**Step 5: Resolve Conflicts**
- Explore possible explanations for conflicts
- Apply evidence weight to determine preponderance
- Resolve conflicts or acknowledge if unresolvable

**Step 6: GPS Compliance Check**
Apply the five GPS elements:
1. Reasonably exhaustive research
2. Complete and accurate source citations
3. Analysis and correlation of evidence
4. Resolution of conflicting evidence
5. Soundly reasoned, coherently written conclusion

**Step 7: Build Proof Argument**
- State conclusion clearly
- Assign appropriate proof level (proven/probable/possible/unproven/disproven)
- Write coherent proof argument explaining reasoning

**Output:** Evidence analysis report using template in `assets/templates/evidence-analysis-template.md`

### 4. Research Logging

**Essential Elements:**
- Research session context (date, time, goal)
- Research questions addressed
- All sources searched (including negative results)
- Search strategies and variations used
- Positive findings with complete citations
- Negative results documented
- Evidence analysis and reliability notes
- Next steps and follow-up actions

**Output:** Research log entry using template in `assets/templates/research-log-template.md`

## Procedural Guidelines

### Research Planning Workflow

To plan a new research project:

1. **Define the objective** - What specific genealogical question needs answering?
2. **Formulate research questions** - Break into 3-7 specific, answerable questions
3. **Identify individuals** - List primary subjects and associated family members
4. **List record sources** - Organize by category (vital, census, land, probate, military, etc.)
5. **Develop strategy** - Prioritize sources, plan FAN approach, work chronologically
6. **Set timeline** - Break into phases with milestones
7. **Apply GPS framework** - Ensure plan addresses all five GPS elements
8. **Define success criteria** - What constitutes adequate proof?
9. **Create next actions** - List 5-10 immediate concrete steps

Reference `references/research-strategies.md` for detailed methodologies.

### Citation Generation Workflow

To create a proper citation:

1. **Identify source type** - Census, vital record, land record, etc.
2. **Determine access method** - Original, microfilm, digital image, database, transcription
3. **Gather information:**
   - Subject/individual name
   - Record type and date
   - Repository and collection
   - Specific location (volume, page, entry)
   - URL and access date (if online)
4. **Select appropriate template** - See `references/citation-templates.md`
5. **Build full citation** - Follow template for source type
6. **Create short form** - Abbreviated version for subsequent references
7. **Generate source list entry** - Formatted for bibliography
8. **Assess source quality:**
   - Original, derivative, or authored?
   - Primary, secondary, or undetermined information?
   - Direct, indirect, or negative evidence?
9. **Extract key information** - Document what the source says
10. **Link to research context** - How does this answer research questions?

### Evidence Analysis Workflow

To analyze conflicting evidence:

1. **Define the research question** - What specific fact is being analyzed?
2. **Create evidence inventory** - List all relevant sources
3. **Evaluate each source individually:**
   - Apply source/information/evidence classification
   - Analyze informant and reliability factors
   - Assign reliability rating
4. **Build comparison matrix** - Show what each source says
5. **Identify conflicts** - Document specific discrepancies
6. **Rank source reliability:**
   - Information timing (primary > secondary)
   - Source type (original > derivative)
   - Informant quality (direct knowledge > hearsay)
   - Consistency (corroborated > standalone)
7. **Identify agreements** - Note corroborating evidence patterns
8. **Apply conflict resolution framework:**
   - Evaluate each side of conflict
   - Consider explanations (error, informant mistake, both partially true)
   - Apply evidence weight
   - Determine preponderance
9. **GPS compliance assessment** - Check all five elements
10. **Write proof argument:**
    - State conclusion
    - Assign proof level
    - Explain reasoning from evidence
11. **Document gaps and recommendations** - What research remains?

Reference `references/evidence-evaluation.md` for detailed guidance.

## Key Genealogical Concepts

### Source Types
- **Original Source** - First recording in original form (courthouse deed book, original certificate)
- **Derivative Source** - Copy, transcription, or database entry
- **Authored Work** - Compiled or analyzed work (published genealogy)

### Information Types
- **Primary Information** - Recorded at/near time of event by knowledgeable person
- **Secondary Information** - Recorded later from memory or hearsay
- **Important:** Original sources can contain secondary information! (e.g., death certificate shows birth date recorded 80 years later)

### Evidence Types
- **Direct Evidence** - Explicitly states the fact needed
- **Indirect Evidence** - Implies fact when combined with other sources
- **Negative Evidence** - Expected information that's absent

### Proof Levels
- **Proven** - Beyond reasonable doubt, no credible conflicts, GPS fully satisfied
- **Probable** - Preponderance of evidence supports, minor conflicts resolved
- **Possible** - Some evidence supports, significant gaps remain
- **Unproven** - Insufficient evidence
- **Disproven** - Evidence contradicts hypothesis

## Best Practices

### Creating Citations
- Cite what you actually consulted (if using database, cite both database and original)
- Include enough detail for others to find the same record
- Follow specific-to-general pattern (item → source → repository)
- Distinguish between original records and database transcriptions

### Analyzing Evidence
- Quality matters more than quantity - one strong source beats three weak ones
- Always consider informant knowledge and proximity to event
- Look for independent corroboration, not derivative repetition
- Acknowledge conflicts honestly rather than ignoring them

### Building Proof Arguments
- State conclusion clearly and precisely
- Choose appropriate proof level for evidence strength
- Explain reasoning transparently
- Address conflicts explicitly and show resolution process
- Acknowledge limitations and gaps

### Research Strategy
- Apply FAN principle - research family, associates, and neighbors
- Document negative results - they're valuable research data
- Work chronologically or geographically in systematic way
- Consider collateral lines for clues about direct ancestors

## Example Usage Patterns

**User:** "I found three census records that say my ancestor was born in Ohio, but his death certificate says Pennsylvania. How do I figure out which is right?"

**Response:** Load `references/evidence-evaluation.md`, apply conflict resolution framework. Evaluate each source for reliability (original vs. derivative, primary vs. secondary information, informant quality). Weight the three consistent earlier sources (John as likely informant) against single later source (unknown informant, secondary information). Analyze possible explanations. Determine preponderance of evidence. Create evidence analysis report documenting reasoning.

**User:** "Help me create a citation for a census record I found on Ancestry."

**Response:** Load `references/citation-templates.md` for census citation template. Gather: year, county, state, page number, household, database name, URL, access date, NARA microfilm info. Build full citation following Evidence Explained format. Create short form and source list entry. Assess source quality (derivative source with digital image of original, secondary information about birth, direct evidence of residence). Document key information extracted.

**User:** "I want to research my great-grandfather but don't know where to start."

**Response:** Guide through research planning workflow. Define objective (identify parents? determine birth location?). Formulate specific research questions. List known information and gaps. Identify potential sources (census, vital records, probate, military). Develop search strategy with priorities. Create timeline. Apply GPS framework. Generate research plan document with concrete next actions.

## Writing Style

Follow genealogical professional standards:
- Use precise, objective language
- Cite sources consistently
- Acknowledge uncertainty appropriately
- Apply technical terms correctly (primary/secondary, original/derivative)
- Structure proof arguments logically
- Balance scholarly rigor with clarity

Always operate within the Genealogical Proof Standard framework, helping researchers build defensible, well-documented conclusions based on thorough evidence analysis.
