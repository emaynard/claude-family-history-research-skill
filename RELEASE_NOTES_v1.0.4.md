# Version 1.0.4: Simplified Research Documentation Templates

This release simplifies the research log template to focus on practical day-to-day use while maintaining professional genealogical standards, following the successful approach from v1.0.3's research plan refactoring.

## What's New

### Research Log Template Refactoring

**Simplified `research-log-template.md`**
- Streamlined for efficient daily research documentation
- Focuses on sections where information is captured and analyzed
- Reduced from comprehensive to practical format
- Sections included:
  - Session metadata and overview
  - Sources searched (quick reference table)
  - What I found (key findings)
  - Source citations
  - Evidence notes (facts and conflicts)
  - Next steps and action items

**New `research-log-guidance.md`**
- Comprehensive methodology reference guide
- Complements the simplified template
- Detailed documentation for advanced researchers
- Coverage includes:
  - Complete session documentation best practices
  - Detailed search strategy documentation
  - Evidence Explained citation requirements
  - Evidence analysis and conflict resolution frameworks
  - Document and image management
  - Research quality assurance and GPS compliance
  - Advanced topics (hypotheses, repositories, expenses, reflection)

## Why This Matters

### Practical Efficiency
The simplified template makes daily research documentation faster and easier without sacrificing professional standards. Researchers can focus on capturing essential information during active research sessions.

### Maintained Rigor
The detailed guidance document ensures that professional genealogical standards (GPS, Evidence Explained, BCG) remain accessible for researchers who need comprehensive methodology.

### Proven Approach
This mirrors the successful refactoring of the research plan template (v1.0.3), providing both:
- A quick, practical tool for daily work
- A detailed reference for understanding methodology

## Template Structure

```

│   ├── citation-template.md
│   ├── evidence-analysis-template.md
│   └── research-log-template.md
```

## Professional Standards

Both templates continue to support:
- **Genealogical Proof Standard (GPS)** - Reasonably exhaustive research documented
- **Evidence Explained** - Complete and accurate citations
- **Board for Certification of Genealogists (BCG)** - Professional methodology

## How to Use

**For Daily Research:** Use the simplified `research-log-template.md`
- Quick to complete
- Captures essential information
- Suitable for most research sessions

**For Reference:** Consult `research-log-guidance.md` when you need:
- Detailed methodology explanation
- Advanced documentation techniques
- Conflict resolution approaches
- Professional standards compliance
- Quality assurance procedures
