# Evidence Evaluation and Conflict Resolution

Detailed frameworks for analyzing genealogical evidence and resolving conflicts between sources.

## Three Key Classifications

### 1. Source Classification (What you consulted)

**Original Source**
- First recording of information in original form
- Created at or near time of event
- Held in original repository
- Examples: courthouse deed books, original certificates, church registers

**Derivative Source**
- Copy, extract, abstract, or transcription
- Created later from original
- Potential for transcription errors
- Examples: published abstracts, database entries, microfilm copies

**Authored Work**
- Compiled or analyzed work with interpretation
- May combine multiple sources
- Examples: published genealogies, county histories

**Why It Matters:**
- Affects reliability assessment
- Guides whether to seek original
- Influences evidence weight
- Determines citation format

### 2. Information Classification (When recorded)

**Primary Information**
- Recorded at or very near time of event
- Informant had direct knowledge
- Less time for memory to fade
- Examples: birth date on birth certificate, marriage date on license

**Secondary Information**
- Recorded well after event occurred
- Often based on memory or hearsay
- More opportunity for error
- Examples: birth date on death certificate (70+ years later)

**Undetermined Information**
- Cannot determine when/how recorded
- Unknown informant or circumstances

**Critical Distinction:**
An ORIGINAL source can contain SECONDARY information!
- Example: Original death certificate (original source) contains birth date (secondary information - reported decades later)

### 3. Evidence Classification (How it answers your question)

**Direct Evidence**
- Explicitly states the fact needed
- Answers question directly
- Example: birth certificate stating birth date

**Indirect Evidence**
- Implies or suggests fact
- Requires combining with other sources
- Example: age on census implies birth year

**Negative Evidence**
- Absence of expected information
- "Silence" that suggests something
- Example: person missing from expected census

## Source Reliability Ranking

### Reliability Factors (highest to lowest)

**Tier 1: Highest Reliability**
- Original source
- Primary information
- Direct evidence
- Informed informant with direct knowledge
- Recorded contemporaneously
- Official/professional record keeper
- Corroborated by multiple independent sources

**Tier 2: Moderate-High Reliability**
- Original source with secondary information
- Derivative source with primary information
- Informed informant but later recording
- Consistent with other sources
- Professional transcription/database

**Tier 3: Moderate Reliability**
- Derivative source with secondary information
- Uncertain informant quality
- Indirect evidence only
- Some inconsistencies with other sources
- Amateur transcription

**Tier 4: Low Reliability**
- Compiled sources with unclear provenance
- Secondary information from unknown informant
- Contradicted by stronger sources
- Known errors in record/database
- Hearsay or family tradition unsupported by documents

## Evidence Comparison Matrix

When analyzing multiple sources, create a systematic comparison:

| Source | What It Says | Info Type | Evidence Type | Reliability | Corroboration |
|--------|--------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| 1850 Census | Age 30, born Ohio | Secondary | Direct | Moderate | 3 sources agree |
| 1860 Census | Age 40, born Ohio | Secondary | Direct | Moderate | 3 sources agree |
| 1870 Census | Age 50, born Ohio | Secondary | Direct | Moderate | 3 sources agree |
| Death Cert 1920 | Age 98, born PA | Secondary | Direct | Low-Mod | Conflicts |

**Pattern Analysis:**
- Three consistent sources vs. one conflicting
- Earlier sources vs. later source
- Likely informed informant (self) vs. unknown informant
- Corroboration pattern strongly favors Ohio

## Conflict Types and Resolutions

### Type 1: Direct Contradictions

**Nature:** Sources explicitly disagree
**Example:** "born Ohio" vs. "born Pennsylvania"

**Resolution Strategy:**
1. Evaluate relative reliability of each source
2. Consider informant quality and proximity
3. Weight earlier/more reliable sources more heavily
4. Look for corroboration patterns
5. Apply preponderance of evidence

### Type 2: Chronological Inconsistencies

**Nature:** Dates don't align logically
**Example:** Married before birth, died before event

**Resolution Strategy:**
1. Check for transcription errors
2. Consider old style vs. new style dates
3. Verify calendar systems (Julian vs. Gregorian)
4. Look for documentation errors
5. Evaluate if actually impossible or unlikely

### Type 3: Minor Variations

**Nature:** Small differences in ages, dates
**Example:** Age differs by 1-2 years across censuses

**Resolution Strategy:**
1. Consider rounding (ages often rounded)
2. Memory errors for secondary information
3. Mathematical errors by enumerator
4. Not necessarily significant conflict
5. May accept range rather than exact date

### Type 4: Name Variations

**Nature:** Different spellings, nicknames
**Example:** Johann/John, Elizabeth/Betsey, Smith/Smythe

**Resolution Strategy:**
1. Consider name evolution over time
2. Research phonetic spellings
3. Cultural naming practices
4. Enumerator's interpretation
5. Often not true conflict

### Type 5: Informant Error

**Nature:** Uninformed informant provided wrong info
**Example:** Neighbor giving deceased's birth info

**Resolution Strategy:**
1. Assess informant's knowledge level
2. Consider relationship to subject
3. Evaluate proximity to event
4. Weight informed sources over uninformed
5. Recognize honest mistakes vs. deception

### Type 6: Both Partially Correct

**Nature:** Each source reflects different truth
**Example:** Born in one place, raised in another (both claimed)

**Resolution Strategy:**
1. Look for evidence of movement
2. Consider "near border" situations
3. Research dual connections
4. Evaluate if both could be true
5. May require accepting complexity

## Conflict Resolution Framework

### Step 1: Evaluate Each Side

For each conflicting source, assess:
- Reliability ranking (Tier 1-4)
- Information type (primary/secondary)
- Informant identity and knowledge
- Timing of record creation
- Consistency with other sources

### Step 2: Explore Explanations

**Possible Explanations for Conflicts:**

**Transcription/Recording Errors**
- Misheard by enumerator
- Handwriting misread
- Database transcription error
- Abbreviation misinterpreted

**Informant Error**
- Memory failure
- Didn't actually know
- Deliberate deception (age fraud)
- Misunderstood question

**Both Partially Correct**
- Born one place, raised another
- Near border (claimed by both)
- Moved shortly after event
- Different specificity levels

**Changed Information**
- Name changes over time
- Adoption/foster situations
- Boundary changes
- Different maiden/married names

**Different Individuals**
- Common name confusion
- Multiple people same name
- Wrong person in database

**Contextual Factors**
- Political pressure
- Legal advantages
- Social stigma avoidance
- Cultural practices

### Step 3: Apply Evidence Weight

**Weighting Principles:**
1. **Quality over Quantity** - One strong source beats three weak ones
2. **Primary over Secondary** - Contemporary recording more reliable
3. **Original over Derivative** - First recording preferred
4. **Informed over Uninformed** - Knowledgeable informant crucial
5. **Corroborated over Standalone** - Independent confirmation strengthens
6. **Earlier over Later** - Closer to event generally better
7. **Consistent over Contradicted** - Pattern matters

**Calculate Preponderance:**
- Assign weight percentages to sources
- Strong, consistent sources = higher weight
- Weak, contradictory sources = lower weight
- Determine where balance tips (>50% threshold)

**Example:**
- 3 census records (Tier 2, consistent): 75% weight
- 1 death certificate (Tier 3, conflicts): 25% weight
- **Preponderance:** 75% favors census version

### Step 4: Determine Resolution

**Resolution Outcomes:**

**Definitively Resolved**
- Preponderance strongly favors one version
- Conflicting source explained satisfactorily
- Independent corroboration supports resolution
- Can state conclusion with confidence

**Probably Resolved**
- Preponderance favors one version
- Some uncertainty remains
- Conflicting source not fully explained
- State conclusion with caveat

**Unresolved**
- Sources equally balanced
- No clear preponderance
- Insufficient additional evidence
- Acknowledge as unresolved conflict
- List what additional research needed

**Both Partially True**
- Evidence supports complexity
- Multiple truths documented
- Explain nuanced situation
- Acknowledge dual realities

## GPS Element 4: Resolving Conflicting Evidence

### Requirements for GPS Compliance

**Identification:**
- All conflicts must be identified
- No conflicts ignored or glossed over
- Contradictions explicitly stated

**Analysis:**
- Each conflict systematically analyzed
- Source reliability assessed
- Informant quality evaluated
- Timing considered

**Resolution or Acknowledgment:**
- Conflicts resolved with reasoning explained
- OR acknowledged as unresolvable
- Weighting explicitly discussed
- Preponderance demonstrated

**Documentation:**
- Resolution process documented
- Reasoning transparent
- Alternative explanations considered
- Evidence weight shown

## Preponderance of Evidence Analysis

**Preponderance Definition:**
The conclusion supported by the strongest, most reliable, most consistent evidence is most likely correct.

**Assessment Questions:**
1. How many sources support each conclusion?
2. What is the quality of sources on each side?
3. Are corroborating sources independent?
4. Which informants were most knowledgeable?
5. Which information is primary vs. secondary?
6. What is the pattern of consistency?

**Preponderance Thresholds:**
- **Strong Preponderance (>75%)** - Proven or Probable
- **Moderate Preponderance (60-75%)** - Probable
- **Slight Preponderance (50-60%)** - Possible
- **No Preponderance (<50%)** - Unproven/Unresolved

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Ignoring conflicts** - GPS requires addressing all conflicts
❌ **Cherry-picking** - Using only sources that support preferred conclusion
❌ **Quantity over quality** - Three weak sources don't outweigh one strong one
❌ **Dismissing later sources** - Later sources can be reliable if primary information
❌ **Assuming original = accurate** - Original sources can contain errors
❌ **Accepting tradition uncritically** - Family stories need documentary corroboration
❌ **Over-weighting one source** - Even strong sources need corroboration
❌ **Under-documenting** - Must show reasoning, not just assert conclusion

## Proof Argument Construction

### Structure of Proof Argument

**1. State Conclusion**
- Answer research question directly
- Be specific (names, dates, places)
- Indicate level of certainty

**2. Present Strongest Evidence**
- Lead with most reliable sources
- Explain source quality
- Show corroboration pattern

**3. Address Conflicts**
- Acknowledge contradictory sources
- Explain reliability differences
- Show resolution reasoning

**4. Apply Evidence Weight**
- Demonstrate preponderance
- Show percentage distribution
- Explain why weighted as done

**5. Acknowledge Limitations**
- Note evidence gaps
- Recognize uncertainty
- Suggest additional research

**6. State Conclusion with Appropriate Proof Level**
- Proven: Beyond reasonable doubt
- Probable: Preponderance supports
- Possible: Some evidence, gaps remain
- Assign level honestly

### Example Proof Argument

**Research Question:** What was John Smith's birth location?

**Conclusion:** John Smith was born in Ohio, circa 1820. [PROBABLE]

**Argument:**

The preponderance of evidence supports John Smith's birth in Ohio around 1820. Three independent federal census enumerations (1850, 1860, 1870) consistently report his birthplace as Ohio, with ages progressing logically from 30 to 40 to 50, implying birth circa 1820. These census records are original documents, with information likely provided by John Smith himself as head of household, making him an informed source despite the secondary nature of birth information recorded decades after the event.

The consistency across three enumerations spanning 20 years, with the same likely informant, significantly strengthens this evidence. Independent corroboration exists in the Ohio birth locations of all known children (1846-1860) and John's documented Ohio residence by 1845 (marriage record).

One conflicting source exists: John's 1920 death certificate reports his birthplace as Pennsylvania. However, this source carries less weight because: (1) the informant is unknown and almost certainly not a family member; (2) the information was recorded 98+ years after John's birth; (3) the informant likely had no direct knowledge; (4) it conflicts with three earlier, more reliable sources. The most plausible explanation is informant error.

Evidence weight distribution: Census records (75%) vs. death certificate (25%). The preponderance strongly favors Ohio birth.

While evidence strongly supports Ohio birth, the specific county cannot be determined from current sources. Pennsylvania cannot be entirely ruled out without positive birth evidence or definitive proof of no Pennsylvania connection.

The "probable" rather than "proven" designation reflects: (1) secondary nature of all birth information; (2) one conflicting source; (3) lack of primary birth evidence. Additional research in Ohio birth/baptism records 1818-1822 would strengthen to "proven."

**This argument demonstrates:**
- Clear conclusion with proof level
- Strongest evidence presented first
- Conflicts addressed honestly
- Weighting explained
- Limitations acknowledged
- Reasoning transparent and logical
