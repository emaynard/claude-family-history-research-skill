# Genealogical Proof Standard (GPS) Guidelines

Detailed requirements for the five-element GPS framework used by professional genealogists.

## Overview

The Genealogical Proof Standard is the professional benchmark for evaluating genealogical conclusions. It consists of five interdependent elements that must ALL be satisfied for a conclusion to meet GPS.

**The Five Elements:**
1. Reasonably exhaustive research
2. Complete and accurate source citations
3. Analysis and correlation of collected information
4. Resolution of conflicting evidence
5. Soundly reasoned, coherently written conclusion

**GPS Compliance Levels:**
- ✅ **Fully GPS-Compliant** - All five elements satisfied
- ⚠️ **Substantially Compliant** - Most elements met, minor gaps
- ❌ **Non-Compliant** - Significant deficiencies in one or more elements

## Element 1: Reasonably Exhaustive Research

### What It Means

Research should be thorough enough that:
- Most relevant sources have been searched
- Unlikely that major contradictory evidence remains undiscovered
- Additional research would probably only confirm existing conclusion
- All "obvious" sources for the time/place/question have been consulted

**NOT:**
- Every conceivable source in existence
- Sources unlikely to contain relevant information
- Sources physically/practically inaccessible

### Assessment Questions

**Have you searched:**
- ✓ All standard sources for the time period and location?
- ✓ Multiple source types (not just one category)?
- ✓ Both direct and indirect sources?
- ✓ Original records where available?
- ✓ Associated persons (FAN principle)?
- ✓ Multiple repositories and databases?

**Can you say:**
- ✓ "I searched all accessible census records 1850-1900"
- ✓ "I searched both original courthouse records and online databases"
- ✓ "I consulted vital records, land records, and probate records"
- ✓ "I searched for siblings, neighbors, and associates"

**Red Flags for Insufficient Research:**
- ❌ Only searched online databases, never accessed original records
- ❌ Only consulted one source type (e.g., only census)
- ❌ Haven't searched negative sources (where person should be but isn't)
- ❌ Haven't researched collateral lines or associates
- ❌ Major record groups not yet searched

### Source Categories to Consider

**Essential Sources (time/place dependent):**
- Census records (federal, state, territorial)
- Vital records (birth, marriage, death)
- Land records (deeds, tax rolls)
- Probate records (wills, estates)
- Church records (baptism, marriage, burial)

**Supporting Sources:**
- Military records
- Immigration/naturalization
- Newspapers
- City directories
- Court records
- School records
- Cemetery records

**Contextual Sources:**
- Published county histories
- Maps and gazetteers
- Record availability guides
- Background histories

**FAN Principle:**
- Family members (parents, siblings, spouses, children)
- Associates (business partners, witnesses)
- Neighbors (clustered in records)

### Documentation of Exhaustive Research

GPS requires demonstrating research was thorough:

**Document:**
- Sources searched (positive and negative results)
- Date ranges searched
- Repositories consulted
- Search strategies used
- Why certain sources weren't searched (unavailable, destroyed, irrelevant)

**Research Log Components:**
- All databases and websites searched
- Physical repositories visited
- Correspondence sent
- Microfilm reviewed
- Books and publications consulted
- Negative results explicitly noted

### When Is Research "Exhaustive Enough"?

**Factors to Consider:**
- Complexity of research question
- Availability of records
- Consistency of evidence found
- Presence/absence of conflicts
- Time period and location challenges

**For "Proven" Conclusion:**
- Must be truly exhaustive
- All major sources searched
- No major gaps
- Pattern of consistent evidence

**For "Probable" Conclusion:**
- Substantially thorough
- Key sources searched
- Some gaps acceptable
- Preponderance of evidence established

**For "Possible" Hypothesis:**
- Preliminary research done
- Some sources searched
- Significant gaps remain
- Needs more research before conclusion

## Element 2: Complete and Accurate Source Citations

### What It Means

Every source used must be:
- Completely cited following accepted standards
- Accurately cited (no errors in transcription)
- Sufficient for others to locate the same source
- Distinguished (original vs. derivative noted)

### Citation Requirements

**Complete Citations Include:**
- **Author/Creator** (if applicable)
- **Title/Description** of source
- **Publication/Creation information**
- **Repository/Location**
- **Specific item location** (page, volume, entry, etc.)
- **Access information** (URL, microfilm, call number)
- **Access date** (for online sources)

**Evidence Explained Standard:**
Three citation forms needed:
1. **Full Reference Note** - Complete first citation
2. **Short Reference Note** - Abbreviated subsequent citations
3. **Source List Entry** - Bibliography format

**Critical Distinctions:**
- Original source vs. derivative vs. database
- Digital image vs. transcription vs. index
- What you actually consulted (not what you wish you consulted)

### Common Citation Errors

❌ "Found on Ancestry" - Too vague, not enough detail
❌ "1870 Census" - Missing county, state, page, household
❌ No URL or access date for online sources
❌ Not distinguishing database transcription from original image
❌ Incomplete repository information
❌ No page numbers or specific location within source

### GPS Compliance for Citations

**Fully Compliant:**
- Every source has complete citation
- Citations follow recognized standard
- Sufficient detail to relocate sources
- Original/derivative distinctions clear

**Non-Compliant:**
- Missing citations for sources used
- Vague or incomplete citations
- No standard format followed
- Cannot relocate sources using citations

## Element 3: Analysis and Correlation

### What It Means

Evidence must be:
- Analyzed individually (each source evaluated for reliability)
- Correlated systematically (sources compared and connected)
- Evaluated collectively (pattern assessment)
- Tested against alternative explanations

**NOT just:**
- Listing sources found
- Transcribing records
- Accumulating information without analysis

### Individual Source Analysis

For each source, evaluate:

**Source Classification:**
- Original, derivative, or authored?

**Information Classification:**
- Primary, secondary, or undetermined?

**Evidence Classification:**
- Direct, indirect, or negative?

**Reliability Factors:**
- Who created the record?
- When was it created relative to event?
- Who provided information?
- What was their knowledge/relationship?
- Any known biases or errors?
- Condition and completeness?

### Correlation Process

**Systematic Comparison:**
- What does each source say about the fact?
- Where do sources agree?
- Where do they conflict?
- Are corroborating sources truly independent?

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Consistent information across multiple sources
- Progressive timeline of information
- Contextual corroboration (related facts fit together)
- Discrepancies that need explanation

**Testing Hypothesis:**
- Does evidence support conclusion?
- What evidence would contradict it?
- Are alternative explanations possible?
- What evidence is missing?

### GPS Compliance for Analysis

**Fully Compliant:**
- Each source analyzed individually
- Sources systematically compared
- Reliability assessed explicitly
- Corroboration demonstrated
- Patterns identified
- Alternative explanations considered

**Non-Compliant:**
- Sources listed without analysis
- No reliability assessment
- Conflicting sources not identified
- No systematic comparison
- Accepts information uncritically

## Element 4: Resolution of Conflicting Evidence

### What It Means

When sources disagree:
- All conflicts must be identified
- Each conflict must be analyzed
- Resolution must be attempted
- If unresolvable, must be acknowledged

**Resolution shows:**
- Why some sources weigh more heavily
- What explanations considered
- How preponderance determined
- What conclusion supported

### Conflict Resolution Requirements

**Identification:**
- Every conflict explicitly stated
- Nature of discrepancy described
- Sources involved identified

**Evaluation:**
- Reliability of conflicting sources assessed
- Information quality compared
- Informant credibility evaluated
- Timing of recording considered

**Explanation:**
- Possible reasons for conflict explored
- Most plausible explanation identified
- Evidence weight explicitly assigned

**Resolution or Acknowledgment:**
- Conflict resolved with reasoning shown
- OR conflict acknowledged as unresolvable
- Preponderance of evidence demonstrated
- Impact on conclusion explained

### GPS Compliance for Conflicts

**Fully Compliant:**
- All conflicts identified and addressed
- Systematic evaluation performed
- Weighting explicitly explained
- Resolution logical and documented
- OR acknowledged as unresolved with impact noted

**Non-Compliant:**
- Conflicts ignored or glossed over
- Conflicting sources not evaluated
- No explanation for weighting
- Cherry-picking evidence
- Dismissing conflicts without analysis

## Element 5: Soundly Reasoned, Coherently Written Conclusion

### What It Means

The conclusion must:
- Answer the research question directly
- Flow logically from the evidence
- Be clearly and coherently written
- Show transparent reasoning
- Acknowledge limitations
- Assign appropriate proof level

### Components of Sound Conclusion

**Logical Reasoning:**
- Proceeds from evidence to conclusion
- Steps explained clearly
- No logical leaps
- Alternative explanations addressed

**Coherent Writing:**
