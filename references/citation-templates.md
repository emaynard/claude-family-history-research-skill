# Genealogical Citation Templates

Complete Evidence Explained citation templates for common genealogical source types.

## Citation Structure Principles

### Layered Citation Pattern
Citations flow from specific to general:
1. **Item level** (most specific) - The particular piece of information
2. **Source level** - The record or publication containing the item
3. **Repository level** (most general) - Where the source is held

### Punctuation
- **Commas** separate elements within layers
- **Semicolons** separate major citation layers
- **Colons** introduce lists or sub-elements
- **Parentheses** enclose clarifications

### Original vs. Derivative
- Cite what you actually consulted
- If using database, cite database AND original source
- Use "citing" to introduce the original source for derivatives

## Citation Best Practices

### Essential Elements
Every citation needs:
- **WHO** - Person(s) the record is about
- **WHAT** - Type of record and specific details
- **WHERE** - Repository, collection, specific location
- **WHEN** - Date of record AND access date (online)
- **HOW** - Access method (digital, microfilm, original)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ "Found on Ancestry" (too vague)
- ❌ Omitting access information for online sources
- ❌ Not distinguishing original from database entry
- ❌ Forgetting page numbers or identifiers
- ❌ Incomplete repository information

### When in Doubt
- Include more detail rather than less
- Check Evidence Explained for your source type
- Save URL and access date for online sources
- Note image quality and completeness
